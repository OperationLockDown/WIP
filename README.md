# Operation: LockDown Developer Builds [WIP]Work in Progress
Operation LockDown Private Developer Builds
Repository for developers of the game and the public to contribute to the awesomeness of the Game!
Every little bit of code from anyone helps, so feel free to send us your code and any bugs you find using the bug tracker.
HOW DO I SUBMIT MY CODE TO YOU?
If you are public, you can click the '+' and request a pull request and we will look and submit your code to our devs.
If you are one of our devs you should be able to import your code at any time the same way. :)
